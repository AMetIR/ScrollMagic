/**
 * This class holds a list of callbacks allows them to be scheduled for execution on next animationFrame.
 * Every callback will only be executed once per animationFrame, even if scheduled multiple times.
 * The order of the queue superceeds the order of scheduling, this means that if the queue consists of callbacks a, b,
 * a will always execute first, even if b is scheduled first.
 *
 * usage example:
 * ```
 * const queue = new ExecutionQueue({
 * 		a: () => console.log('a');
 * 		b: () => console.log('b');
 * })
 * queue.commands.b.schedule();
 * queue.commands.a.schedule();
 * <expected output on animationFrame>
 * 'a'
 * 'b'
 * ```
 *
 * For details about conditional execution see Command class below.
 *
 * To invoke execution now (and purge scheduled), call queue.execute.
 * To cancel scheduled execution, call queue.cancel
